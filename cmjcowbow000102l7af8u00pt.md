## In simple terms, it is the legal rulebook that keeps Linux "free." When people say Linux is "free software," they don't just mean it costs zero money (though it usually does); they mean it grants you freedom.

### Here is the breakdown of what that actually mean:

1. The "Copyleft" Rule Most software licenses like Windows or macOS are "Copyright"—they restrict what we can do. The GPL is "Copyleft"—it uses copyright laws to guarantee your rights rather than take them away.
    

It has one golden rule: If you change the software and give it to others, you must give them the same freedoms you received. You cannot turn it into a secret, closed product.

### The Four Essential Freedoms Under the GPL, anyone who uses Linux has four specific rights:

1. The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
    
2. The freedom to study how the program works and change it.
    
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
    
4. The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public.
    

Why being GPL, matter for Linux, Because no single company owns it. Thousands of developers from all over the world (including companies like Google, Intel, and Red Hat) contribute code to Linux, knowing that their work will remain free and open for everyone to use forever.
