1. Hardware:- Hardware layer consists of physical decides like,
    
    Example:- CPU, Memory, input and output devices, etc.
    
2. Kernel: Often described as the heart of Linux, the kernel is the most important part of the Linux operating system. It's called the "heart" because it's the core component. The kernel acts as a bridge between software and hardware, managing essential functions like CPU time, memory, and devices.
    
3. Shell:- In Linux, the shell is an interface for user interaction with the operating system kernel.
    
4. Application: An application is a software package designed to help the end-user perform specific, goal-oriented tasks, e.g., web browsers (Firefox, Chrome), office suites (LibreOffice), and email clients.
    
5. System utilities: Tools for file management, system monitoring, and software installation.
